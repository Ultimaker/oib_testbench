This directory contains a simple u-boot script that checks the pinout of the
Olimex Interface board 2005-F.

There are 4 leds on the boards the operator should look at. The red power led
immediatly lights up when power has been applied. When the test is finished
the green led is solid.
Uppon error, The amber leds indicate the error state. Currently they only blink.

To build a new image, the following steps need to be done, note filenames
may be different, for example /dev/loop0 etc. While a working u-boot is
supplied in this repo, any u-boot should work.

Create an sd card image of about 2 MiB.
dd if=/dev/zero of=oib_testbench.img bs=1M count=2
/sbin/sfdisk -uS --force oib_testbench.img <<-EOT
2048,,L
EOT
sudo losetup --show -o $((2048 * 512)) -f oib_testbench.img
sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/loop0 -L oib_testbench
sudo mount /dev/loop0 /mnt
sudo mkimage -A arm -O linux -T script -C none -a 0 -e 0 -n "OIB test script v0.1" -d u-boot_oib_testbench.cmd /mnt/boot.scr
sudo umount /dev/loop0
sudo losetup -d /dev/loop0
dd if=u-boot-sunxi-with-spl.bin of=oib_testbench.img bs=1024 seek=8 conv=notrunc 
mkenvimage -s 131072 -p 0x00 -o u-boot_oib_testbench.env.bin u-boot_oib_testbench.env
dd if=u-boot_oib_testbench.env.bin of=oib_testbench.img bs=1024 seek=544 conv=notrunc 

Finally flash the image to the target medium, for example:
dd if=oid_testbench.img of=/dev/sdc

Note that the partition be unmounted before flashing the image, and to
properly eject the device after writing.
